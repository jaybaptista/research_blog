## Research Goals
Given that this is my first opportunity to do research, especially here at Yale, I hope that I can gain insight into the reading and writing of astrophysical research. In the context of my research topic (i.e. *ultra-faint dwarf galaxies*), I wish to understand more about the nature of how these objects can allow us to explore the origins of the Milky Way, what UFDs can tell us about stellar formation, and dark matters effect on galaxy evolution.
