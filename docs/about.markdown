Hi! This site is used to publish my personal progress on research projects under the STARS Summer fellowship and beyond. My personal site is at [jaybaptista.github.io](jaybaptista.github.io). I am currently working with the Geha lab in galactic observational astronomy, specifically focusing on the satellites of the Milky Way and how they might unlock secrets about dark matter and the galactic halo.
